            My name is John and I am from Los Angeles, California.  I have grown up in California and lived there until this past fall.  I have one dog and two cats.  I have an older sister who is a great role model for me.  I am happy with where I came from.

        <p style="font-family:Calibri">
            My favorite activities are soccer, basketball, video games, and snowboarding.  I grew up close to the ocean so I also enjoy the beach.  I plan to learn how to surf in the future.  I hopefully will travel the world after I graduate.  I have never been out of the country but I would love to visit Italy.
